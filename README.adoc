= Spring Cloud Config Example Project
Sample test project with spring cloud config to get intro stuff working

Project includes the following components:

* config server application - application that hosts config server
* config client application - that connects to server application and reads values stored there
* config folder - folder that includes yaml (or .properties) file(s) with values for config server to provide to other apps
** Note: the config file is set up for a local file folder. To change this, adapt the value of `spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri` property in the config-server's application.properties file to point to another location.
